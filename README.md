# Paxos-Consensus-Algorithm
This project demonstrates a simplified Paxos consensus algorithm implementation for leader election using Python Flask, packaged and deployed through Docker Compose. Each node in the system runs as an independent Flask server inside a Docker container, listening on a unique port number that represents its Node ID. Nodes communicate with each other by sending HTTP POST requests to a shared /propose endpoint, where each node proposes itself as the leader. The leader election rule follows the Paxos principle where nodes accept the proposal with the smallest proposer ID, ensuring that the node with the lowest ID (smallest port number) becomes the agreed leader among all nodes. The setup includes three core files: paxos_leader.py for the leader election logic, a Dockerfile to define the application environment, and a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate running multiple container instances representing different nodes. Users need to have Docker Desktop installed, build the system using docker-compose build, and then start the leader election process with docker-compose up. Upon running, users can observe logs indicating which node has been elected as the leader. This setup is ideal for educational purposes and helps understand the basics of distributed consensus mechanisms using containerized environments.
